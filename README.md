# Eiffel Sandbox
The Eiffel Sandbox provides a Docker image where multiple Eiffel [actors and event services](http://eiffel-community.github.io/eiffel-sepia) are pre-configured in a single life-like environment. This lets users and developers play around with and try out Eiffel concepts and implementations in a safe setting with a minimum of effort. To get started, see __How to Run__ and __How it Works__ below.

__Note:__ At present, the sandbox includes several implementations to be contributed to open source in the very near future. The Docker images are available, but the sources are not yet. Please stay tuned for the sources to turn up on GitHub soon.
